# Interactive Card Details Form

## Overview
This project is a solution to the [Interactive Card Details Form Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/interactive-card-details-form-XpS8cKZDWw) on Frontend Mentor. The goal is to build a responsive and interactive form where users can enter their card details. The form should provide real-time feedback and validation to enhance user experience.

## Features
- **Real-time Card Preview**: As users input their card details, a visual card preview updates in real-time.
- **Form Validation**: Includes client-side validation to ensure users input valid card information (e.g., correct card number format, expiration date).
- **Responsive Design**: The form is fully responsive and looks great on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
- **Modern UI**: A clean and user-friendly interface.

## Usage
1. **Open the form**: After opening the `index.html`, you'll see the card form.
2. **Enter card details**: Input the card number, name, expiration date, and CVV.
3. **Real-time updates**: Watch as the card preview updates with your input.
4. **Submit**: Upon submitting, the form will validate your input and show either success or error messages.
